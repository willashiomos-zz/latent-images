                            Welcome back to Latent Images.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We only say “welcome back” because Latent Images has been a part of the Emerson community since 1989. A club dedicated to discussion 
                            of film criticism on campus, Latent Images published its own magazine and website until it lost 
                            traction in 2003. In the last seventeen years, so much has changed: digital cameras are now industry 
                            standard; Disney become a world conglomerate; and Blockbuster seems like an urban legend. What has not 
                            changed, however, is a need for intelligent film criticism. As filmmakers and consumers, we must continue to interrogate 
                            our medium. Why do we like it? What does it say about ourselves and our world? What is missing or not working here? 
                            These questions are evolving and multi-layered, and continue to beguile us seventeen years later. 
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            Having an on-campus outlet to write and discuss this subject matter is just as important as learning the tools on set 
                            and in the lab. Latent Images is here to provide such a resource and help further expand our love of film. 
                            With this rebranding, we aim to bring the late-night dorm room rants, the conversations from a long walk 
                            back from the Coolidge or The Brattle to a public space, and dining hall arguments about auteurs to a shared 
                            online space. A mission of ours is to bring in the many talented voices of Emerson—and when we say Emerson, 
                            we mean all Emerson College students (and also some students outside of our institution!) 
                            Even though we may have a dedicated writing staff, all writings and art and voices are welcome and respected. 
                            Film, as a medium, possesses the transcendent ability to amass a community of lovers, fanatics and casual 
                            watchers of all stripes; here at Latent Images, we recognize this and embrace it. 
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>So welcome back, it’s been a long time coming. There’s so much we need to catch up on! </p>

                            assortment of wigs throughout the years — amongst other things. He would like to take this time to
                            remind everyone that every year is another year that <em>Carol</em> can win best picture.

                        Matt can be found writing horror movie reviews, writing think-pieces on horror subgenres, 
                        and infrequently discussing the avant-garde.

                            Micah Levine knew that film would be his passion at the age of eight, when he watched 
                            James Cameron’s <em>The Abyss</em> for reasons he currently does not know. A sophomore at Emerson, 
                            he is the treasurer of Latent Images, as well as a featured staff writer. Micah also helps 
                            with operations at Films from the Margin, and produces/co-hosts an upcoming podcast 
                            breaking down box office statistics. Micah is known for his intense love of both John 
                            Cassavetes and <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>. Finally, a man with taste.

                        Max is a staff writer for Latent Images who spent too much time glued to the television when he should have been learning to 
                        socialize. Because of this, he has an extensive knowledge on cartoons and children's 
                        programming. This obsession with animation permeated into a film taste that mainly goes 
                        towards the surreal and experimental. It does not just help with writing for Latent Images, 
                        but also helps with programming for our partner organization ‘Films from the Margin’. 
                        Max can also be found walking at the esplanade and starting mosh pits in Allston basements. 
                        Whatever you do, avoid discussion of The Modern Lovers or ‘Czech New Wave’.
